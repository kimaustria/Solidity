# Motivation for Profit Splitting

Profit splitting is used to evenly distrubte funds using pre-authorized addresses to which these funds will automatically be deposited into their crypto wallets without having to manually calculate sn smount for each person.

# Creating Smart Contract

1. Create a new contract and name is AssociateProfitSplitter.sol
2. Once contract is successfully created two additional files will be created (.json and metadata.json)
3. Start by creating a payable address code for three employees
4. Create a code in which a desired amount will be split evenly between the three employees
5. Create a code to transfer the desired amount to the employees
6. Once above steps are completed make sure your compiler is set to 0.5.0+commit.1d4f565a
7. Click Compile "AssociateProfitSpliter.sol"
